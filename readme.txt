* A checkbox option is added to all post or page editor sidebars.

= Roadmap =

Other than updating the plugin for compatibility with Themes, Page builders, Gutenberg or new WordPress versions we do not anticipate any further development of this plugin. It is a lightweight addon that adds the Hide the Title feature to WordPress. This is a feature that could and arguably should be in the WordPress core.
